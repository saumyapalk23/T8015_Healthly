            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We are a group of DNHS students just like you. 
                Our purpose is to help improve the environment on campus through working together to help alleviate stress and 
                mental pressures on students throughout our school. Many students in response to the hypercompetitveness surrounding 
                have been pushed to take on many extracurriculars and difficult academic course loads. This all in conjunction to the weird
                 transition period that is high school and being a teenager, it can all seem very daunting at first glance. We hope to
                  change this and one of our first steps is through this website. This website is dedicated towards linking students 
                  to each other, helping them build up a social network where they will be able to support and relate to each other. 
                  Another task we hope to accomplish is to also give resources to students to help them through any hard times ahead- 
                  such as access to suicide helplines and tips to help regulate mental health. To accomplish such a goal, we have prepared
                  several features in this website: chats to help students more easily get in touch with like-minded friends and adults who 
                  can always offer help, articles/blogs which can either serve as a way to help reflect on own experiences as well as share 
                  with other students, planners that students can use to help better organize schoolwork and personal life, and lastly mental 
                  health sources that students are always free to explore and use </h5>
